Sachiscape is not only a full-featured 2D platformer game playable both in your browser at [https://nauja.github.io/sachiscape/](https://nauja.github.io/sachiscape/), and on your desktop, but also a reference for coding 2D games with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) thanks to its open source code.

:warning: this game is not released yet and is still in work in progress.
